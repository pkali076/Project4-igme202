# Project4-igme202

Name: Philip Kalinowski
Section: 02

# Description
 
 The project is based on Human vs. Zombies. There is functionality for both game objects. Zombies will wander for a while after the humans and then reconvene in the center of the map. Humans flee.

 # User Responsibilities
 N/A

 # Known Issues
 No user responsibilities; Wander() seems to not work as well as intended. Humans do not seem to Zombies do not Pusue the Humans as readily as intended.

 # Requirements Not Completed
 There is no player functionality; and the Zombies do not readily chase every human being -- they seem to return to the center of the map; as though that is their default desiredLocation... Humans run to opposing corners; difficult to say whether they Flee or not.
